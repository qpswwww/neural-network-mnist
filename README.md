# A Simple Implementation of Neural Network Based on C++

## Project Info

**the Course Project of Advanced Programming Language**

**Supervisor:** Chengyu TAN

## Project Description

- The classification of handwritten digits is one of the basic problems of machine learning and pattern recognition, which is also the key technology of optical character recognition(OCR). 
  
- In this project, according to the MNIST handwritten digits dataset, I implemented a classifying algorithm based on multi-layer perceptron(MLP) by C, and optimize it by cross-validation, mini-batch stochastic gradient descent algorithm and expanding the training dataset. The accuracy of our algorithm reaches 98.042%.
